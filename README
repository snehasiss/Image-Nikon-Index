Image-Nikon-Index version 0.01
==============================

Image::Nikon::Index is a simple package to restructure Nikon format
camera generated image files, which takes up a naming format easy
for indexing and archiving. The package changes default file names
into a format containing date in compact form and indexed in order
of when the photos have been taken.

For a photo taken on 2015 Jun 12 at 8:35:20, which may have been
subsequently modified at a later date or time, the name update is
as below:

  original name: DSC_2019.NEF
  date and time: 2015 Jun 12 at 8:35:20
  subtime  mexp: 30
  updated  time: 2015 Jun 12 at 18:20:10
  image newname: E612_SERIAL.NEF
  
Now, that SERIAL is generated by sorting based on date and time
for which the key is 2015061208352020150612182010, consisting of
original date, time, updated date, time.
